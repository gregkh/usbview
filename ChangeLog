version 2.0
	- use debugfs (Hans de Goede)
	- convert to use gtk 3.0 (Hans de Goede)

version 1.1
	- pretty icon (thanks to Bernhard).
	- gtk 2.0 support (finally, after many people submitted patches
	  adding it, thanks for not letting me forget).
	- added "..." to About and Configure dialogs based on comments by
	  Emil Brink.
	- added patch from Emil Brink <emil.brink@interactiveinstitute.se>
	  that fixed gtk warning when about dialog was displayed.

version 1.0
	- fixed problem for devices that grabed more than one interface, the
	  name of the device would show up repeated a bunch.  This was true
	  for a lot of audio and video devices.
	- Tweaked the configuration dialog a bit.
	- Tweaked the about dialog a bit.
	- Everything seems stable, so let's put a major number on this release.
	- added a pixmap hacked up from an image by M G Berberich
	  <berberic@fmi.uni-passau.de> to the about screen
	- cleaned up the spec file to hopefully build a bit better on
	  different versions of different distros.

version 0.9.0
	- added Trond Eivind Glomsrød's patch to always try to populate the
	  device tree when the program is started.
	- cleaned up the code layout, removing the i18n code for now. Also
	  got rid of some old Glade helper code that was not being used. This
	  reduced the tarball size by about 1/2!
	- usbview now updates the device list when devices are plugged in or
	  removed from the bus automatically (needs 2.4.0-test8 or later to
	  work properly due to a patch I made for drivers/usb/inode.c to
	  enable this to work.)
	- Made any device that does not have a driver associated with it, show
	  up in red in the device listing.  This should help users with the
	  problem that "My device shows up properly in usbview, but it isn't
	  working," that a lot of people seem to have (it isn't obvious, I
	  know...)
	- Added small, drab looking "About" dialog box, to make it easier to
	  determine which version this is.

version 0.8.1
	- fixed the Gtk-WARNING that happens the first time you press the
	  [Refresh] button.
	- sped up the device info display a bunch. Should work a lot better
	  for devices that have a lot of interfaces and endpoints.
	- fixed #ifdef bug in code. Thanks to Trond Eivind Glomsrød for
	  noticing this and providing a patch.
	- fixed improper speed display for low speed devices. Thanks to
	  Brad Hards for noticing this and prompting me to add support
	  for high speed USB (like there will not be other changes for
	  high speed when it happens...)

version 0.8.0
	- Added ability to select where the devices file is located at.
	  This allows you to view a usbdevfs devices file that comes
	  from another user, for instance. It also accomidates those who
	  do not mount usbdevfs at /proc/bus/usb.
	- Fixed bug with devices that have a lot of interfaces.
	- Changed the tree widget to a different style.
	- Restructured the internal code a bit nicer (a lot of work to
	  go with this...)
	- Added a TODO file to the archive listing some potential changes
	  that could be done.

version 0.7.0
	- the logic for determining the name of the device changed to
	  properly display the name of a keyboard or mouse when the
	  HID driver is used. This is needed for kernel versions 2.3.36
	  and up.

version 0.6.0
	- now can handle multiple root hubs.
	- added display of bus bandwidth information for root hubs.
	- added support for device strings to describe the device.
	- made logic for device name to be smarter due to the availability
	  of the string descriptors.

version 0.5.0
	- updated the parser to handle the fact that the interface now
	  dictates what driver is loaded.
	- Tested on kernel version 2.3.29

version 0.4.0
	- redid the user interface slightly, making the tree always expanded,
	  showing the top of the text field, and better balancing the splitter
	  bar.

version 0.3.0
	- changed the parsing to make it easier to handle any future changes
	  in the way the format of /proc/bus/usb/devices

version 0.2.0:
	- Configuration, interface, and endpoint data is now displayed
	  for each device.
	- Fixed problem with processing the last line in the /proc/... file
	  twice.

Initial version 0.1.0:
	- devices are read from /proc/bus/usb/devices and put into a tree view
	- very basic information is displayed about each device when it is
	  selected
